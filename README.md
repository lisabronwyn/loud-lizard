##Selected Algorithm Solutions

###Return Largest Numbers
```javascript
function largestOfFour(arr) {
var results = [];
for (var n = 0; n < arr.length; n++) {
var largestNumber = 0;
for (var sb = 0; sb < arr[n].length; sb++) {
if (arr[n][sb] > largestNumber) {
largestNumber = arr[n][sb];
}
}

results[n] = largestNumber;
}

return results;
}

// largestOfFour([[4, 5, 1, 3], [13, 27, 18, 26], [32, 35, 37, 39], [1000, 1001, 857, 1]]);
```

###Slasher Flick
```javascript

function slasher(arr, howMany) {
  // it doesn't always pay to be first
  return arr.slice(howMany);
}

slasher([1, 2, 3], 2);
```

 * Tutorials marked with an * above were very beneficial. (Explanations of why are below) 
 
 \* On FCC's JavaScript Lingo: Regular Expressions, "learn it, know it" can be a great help for changing strings and for the manipulation of user input.

 \** On A Smarter Way to Learn JS, we learned that the placement of operators matters when assigning values to a new variable. Example: x-- vs --x
 
 \*** On Tutorials Point, we learned that all Express methods are equivalent to HTTP verbs (i.e., post, Git, etc.) If code works for small calculations/data, it's not always efficient when scaled to larger calculations/data.
 
 \**** Difference between MongoDB (aka NoSQL type database) and traditional tabular (aka relational type / SQL) databases. When to consider each, pros and cons of each, and examples of how each database can be used for the same project.
